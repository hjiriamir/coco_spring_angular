# CoCo App !

## Introduction

The CoCo app is a comprehensive platform designed to enhance the ESPRIT student experience by facilitating carpooling, room sharing, marketplace transactions, and more, all within a single, user-friendly application. This project aims to address common logistical challenges faced by students, such as finding affordable transportation and accommodation, by leveraging a dynamic role-based system that adapts to users' varying needs.

## Features

- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Users can assume multiple roles (e.g., Driver, Passenger, Host, Roomseeker) based on their activities.
- **Carpooling**: Offers a platform for students to share rides, reducing travel costs and environmental impact.
- **Room Sharing**: Facilitates finding and offering accommodation to help students find suitable living arrangements.
- **Marketplace**: A platform for buying, selling, and renting goods within the student community.
- **Delivery Services**: Enables users to offer or request delivery services for items bought or sold through the app.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes JWT for secure login and role-based access control.
